<h2>Terms & Condition</h2>
<p>
    We guarantee you the best available rate when you book a room through an official Four Seasons website. If you find a lower publicly available rate (“Lower Rate”) elsewhere within 24 hours of making your booking, we will match the lower rate, subject to the following terms and conditions:
<li>Reservations must be made through one of the Four Seasons official websites.</li>
<li> The Lower Rate must be for the same type of accommodation, which means the same room type, at the same hotel or resort, with the same dates and length of stay, same number of guests, with a similar view or room size, same designation as either cancellable or non-cancellable, same advance purchase policies and the same terms and conditions governing the room rate.</li>
<li>You must complete and submit a claim submittal web form to Four Seasons in accordance with the claim form’s instructions to process the claim.</li>
<li>  You may submit only one claim for each stay. A “stay” means the total number of consecutive nights spent at the same hotel or resort by the same guest or guests. You must complete the stay.</li>
<li> Rate comparisons will be made net of taxes, gratuities, service charges, early departure fees, or other fees and incidental charges. Free breakfast and free or discounted amenities or services offered as part of the Lower Rate will be excluded from the rate comparison, and will not be provided by Four Seasons when matching the Lower Rate.</li>
